This project  presents a Python tool for use in predicting flight times
of indoor rubber-powered models. It is based on an article by Doug McLean found
in the 1976 NFFS Symposium titled "A Method for Predicting Indoor Model
Duration".

The theory presented in McLean's paper is elaborated here using Python SymPy to
ensure all equations are correct. Furthermore all dimensional units are managed
by the Python **pint** package, which handles unit conversions as needed.

This project contains two sets of documents. An article scheduled for
publication in the 2022 NFFS Symposium is included, and documentation covering
the final Python tool is included as well.

The NFFS Symposium article was written using LaTeX. Those source files are
converted to a PDF file suitable for offline reading or printing. The source
files are also converted to a Word document for publication by NFFS. Because of
space limitations, the article does not present the final Python code developed
for this project. That code is documented separately and is available in this
repository. The documentation presented at the link above will describe the
project code more fully.

If you find any of this material useful, I invite to to contact me for help in
getting this program running on your system. I also welcome suggestions for
improvements, and ideas for enhancements. Feel free to contact me at the email
address above.
