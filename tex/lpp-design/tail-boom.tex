\subsection{Tail Boom}

After building the motor stick, the tail boom is something of a letdown. All we
need here is a basic stick, but tapered from the front to the rear.

\begin{lstlisting}
module tail_boom(
	thickness = 1/16,
	front_height = 3/16,
	rear_height = 1/16
	) {
  ...
}
\end{lstlisting}

We will see this part when we assemble the airplane
