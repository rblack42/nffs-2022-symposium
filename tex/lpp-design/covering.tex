\subsection{Modeling the Covering}

\osc\ does not provide a simple way to add covering to our design. However, I
did find some code written by Justin Lin :\cite{lin} that can help. Justin
created a module called {\it Bezier Surface} which takes an 3D matrix of control
points and fits a smooth surface through all those points. We can then plot the
smooth surface and give it a color so we can see it. I am using a blue glass
color which is transparent so we can see the structure behind the surface.

Even better, we can submit this surface to the same analysis we will be using to
get weights and center of gravity data and add this new feature to our
analysis.

This is where that wing surface function we figured out earlier  will be used.
I set up code that generates the needed surface points,, then used Lin's code to
build a model of our covering. I made the covering thin enough so it will look
right, and estimated the density needed to match real Mylar we might be using.

The code for this feature is a bit more involved, so I will refer you to the
project website for details.
