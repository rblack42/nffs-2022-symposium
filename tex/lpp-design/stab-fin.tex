\subsection{Stabilizer and Fin}

The code we created to build the wing provides everything needed to build the
stabilizer and fin.

\subsubsection{stabilizer}

The stab is identical to the wing, except in dimension and
number of ribs. The modules used for the wing give us everything needed to
build the stabilizer.

Figure \ref{fig:stab.png} shows the result.

\subsubsection{Vertical Fin}

The fin is a slightly different version of the tips. The only addition here is
a square spar at the base of the fin. As we will see, we will mount the fin at
an offset, and not glue it directly to the tail boom.

Figure \ref{fig:rudder.png} shows the fin.
