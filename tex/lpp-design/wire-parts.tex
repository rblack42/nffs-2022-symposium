\subsection{Wire Parts}

As I got to the end of this design, I wanted to finish it off by building the
wire parts. I managed to find a few examples on {Thingiverse} that provided
clues as to how I might do this. Unfortunately, the code is far too involved to
present here. Instead, I will show one image from my experiments.

\importimage{front-shaft.jpg}{Simple Prop Shaft}

figure \ref{fig:front-shaft.jpg} shows an experiment. In this figure we see a basic
propeller shaft and pieces of a wire bearing. The full code has this part
finished off.

The wires are formed using very skinny cylinders. The curves in the wire are
made using another extrusion operation provided with \osc\ called a {\bf
rotate\_extrude}, which extrudes around a circular arc. The spring like part
needed help from another piece of code found on the Internet. Getting this code
running took a bit of work!
