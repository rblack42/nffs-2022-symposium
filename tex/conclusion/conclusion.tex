\section{Conclusion}

I hope I have shown you that \osc\ can be a powerful tool to add to your
building. Yes, it may get you involved with programming, but that is not
necessarily bad, You might discover that all kids in school are learning how to
program computers these days.

Using fee tools like this is a great way to get started down this path. MY hope
is that I can add come more detailed analytical tools to my project to get a
better feel for how well this craft will fly. I did get degrees in Aerospace
Engineering, but that was a long time ago.

Have fun trying this out, and please visit the project website. All of the
details I could not fit into this article will be there, and anything else I
come up with in the future.

If you need help with any of this, you can contact me at roie.black@gmail.com.
I always welcome feedback on my projects!
